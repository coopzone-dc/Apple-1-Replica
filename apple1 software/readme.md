Mostly games collected from various places.

Some tested some not! so your milage may vary! I have patched some of the program to work with the SBC6502. Not tested extensively. 

They are mostly memory images of BASIC games, to run them:

Set your terminal to have a end of line delay (try 50ms), set a character delay (tty 1ms)

Then open the file, copy it and paste into the Wozmon monitor.
